As a beginner to Vim in Windows PowerShell, I choose to rename my configuration file from `C:\Promgram Files\Vim\_vimrc` to `C:\Promgram Files\Vim\_vimrc`, eliminating the prefix underline from the original file name for two reasons, a) `vimrc` has a higher priority over `_vimrc`, and b) `vimrc` is easier to type when reload the modified configuration file.
