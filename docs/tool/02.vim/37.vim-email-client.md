Below are the tools I use. I will detail how I use all of them in this blog post.

- Neomutt - Email client:
  - Cygwin
  - Use Cygwin to install NeoMutt
- NeoVim - Email editor
- Mbsync - Email downloader:
  - Install getmail6, but turned out to be a deadend
  - Install [insync](https://www.insynchq.com/downloads/windows) instead
- Notmuch - Email indexer (for searching)
- Msmtp - Email sender
- Davmail - Bridge for MS Exchange
- ImapFilter - Email filterer
- Abook - Contact manager
