Writing Markdown in Vim

## Folding

Folding is enabled for headers by default.

The following commands are useful to open and close folds:

- `zr`: reduces fold level throughout the buffer
- `zR`: opens all folds
- `zm`: increases fold level throughout the buffer
- `zM`: folds everything all the way
- `za`: toggle a fold your cursor is on
- `zA`: toggle a fold your cursor is on recursively
- `zo`: open a fold your cursor is on
- `zO`: open a fold your cursor is on recursively
- `zc`: close a fold your cursor is on
- `zC`: close a fold your cursor is on recursively

Options are available to disable folding or change folding style.

Try `:help fold-expr` and `:help fold-commands` for details.
