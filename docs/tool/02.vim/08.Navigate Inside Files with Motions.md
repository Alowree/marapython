## 47. Keep Your Fingers on the Home Row

Vim is optimized for the touch typist. Learn to move around without removing your hands from the home row, and you'll be able to operate Vim quicker.

## 48. Distinguish Between Real Lines and Display Lines

Avoid frustration by learning the difference between real lines and disply lines. Vim lets us operate on both.

- The `j` and `k` commands move down and up by real lines
- The `gj` and `gk` commands move down and up by display lines

Note the pattern: `j` `k`, `0`, and `$` all interact with real lines, while prefixing any of these with `g` tells Vim to act on display lines instead.

## 49. Move Word-Wise

Vim has two speeds for moving backward and forward word-wise. Both allow for a more rapid traversal than moving by one column at a time.

| Command | Move Cursor                                |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `w`     | Forward to start of next word              |
| `b`     | Backward to start of current/previous word |
| `e`     | Forward to end of current/next word        |
| `ge`    | Backward to end of previous word           |

## 50. Find by Character

Vim's character search commands allow us to move quickly within a line, and they work beautifully in Operator-Pending mode.

| Command   | Effect                                                            |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `f{char}` | Forward to the next occurrence of {char}                          |
| `F{char}` | Backward to the previous occurrence of {char}                     |
| `t{char}` | Forward to the character before the next occurrence of {char}     |
| `T{char}` | Backward to the character after the previous occurrence of {char} |
| `;`       | Repeat the last character-search command                          |
| `,`       | Reverse the last character-search command                         |

1. Don't Throw Away the Reverse Character Search Command
2. Character Searches Can Include or Exclude the Target
3. Think Like a Scrabble Player

Capital letters are much rarer, and so too are punctuation marks. When using the character search commands, it's better to choose target characters with a low frequency of occurrences.
