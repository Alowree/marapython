This is not an official guide, but rather a step by step use log of the commands that I ever used on my machines.

- `v` Enter visual mode (selection mode)
- `y` Yank selected files (copy)
- `p` Paste yanked files

I tried to use Yazi to copy `nvim` folder from `dotfiles` to `.config`, where an older version of `nvim` already exists. The newly pasted folder will be automatically renamed to `nvim_1`. Delete the older `nvim`, and then rename `nvim_1` to `nvim`.

Now you have the most recent Neovim config updated from the remote repository.

Is there a better way to share config files between Windows and MacOS?
