## What is nvim-surround

- Add/change/delete surrounding delimiter pairs with ease
- A plugin for Neovim written in Lua
- `kylechui/nvim-surround`

## Text objects

In Vim, text objects allow you to select pieces of text based on their structure or syntax. Here is a list of common text objects in ascending order by their typical size:

- a character (`v` or `V`): `v`
- a word (`w` and `iw`): `iw`
- a WORD (an entire string of non-blank characters, `W` and `iW`): `iW`
- a sentence (`as` and `is`): `is`
- a paragraph (`ap` and `ip`): `ip`
- a block of text enclosed in delimiters (`a(`, `a)`, `ab`, `aB`, `a{`, `a}`, `i(`, `i)`, `ib`, `iB`, `i{`, `i}`): `i(`, `a)`
- a block of text enclosed in quotes (`a'`, `a"`, `i'`, `i"`): `i'`, `a"`

These text objects are invaluable when working with the `nvim-surround` plugin for efficient text editing within Vim.
