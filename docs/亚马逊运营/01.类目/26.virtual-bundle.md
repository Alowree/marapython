We have two virtual bundles, with parent asins and child asins, details as follows:

1. virtual bundle, parent asin B0D1B3YZ67 - black
   a. Child asin B09V9NVSSH, FCC ID: 2A3UZ-SFQ16
   b. Child asin B0CZK7K1Y7, FCC ID: 2AFP2FC14

2. virtual bundle, parent asin B0CXDRQH5W - wood
   a. Child asin B09VB12M1B, FCC ID: 2A3UZ-SFQ16
   b. Child asin B09VY9ZRGM, FCC ID: 2AFP2FC14

Upon creation, both virtual bundles have been removed for "Restricted Products Policy Violation".

With each standalone and independent child asin already has its own fcc id provided, why does the virtual bundle (parent asins) still require an fcc id? Even if we want to take the efforts to fill out the required fcc id, there is no access point for us to do so on these two virtual bundle products.

Please guide us through the necessary process to reactive these two blocked removed virtual bundles. Thank you.
