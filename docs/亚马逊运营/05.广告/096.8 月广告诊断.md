Observations

1. Cate07 starts 0724 and performs
   - up and down, by placement=0%
   - 0724-0814 budget=$20, consumptionRate=100%
   - 0814 budget=$55, comsumptionRate=?
   - shall we increase the budget? No
   - shall we increase bidding so as the impressions and clicks?
2. Auto8 starts 0805 and spends the most, ACOS=51.98% exceeds target
   - 0804-0814 budget=$30, consumptionRate=100%
   - 0814 budget=$60, consumptionRate=?
   - CPC is 67% higher than that of Cate07 and is competing against Cate07, to be reduced
   - Wood does not perform, to be closed
3. Charge Rise II, CPC=1.75-2.31, too high as compared to system suggested bidding, so spending is burning fast out of budget

Observations

1. Category07
   - 0814 budget=$55, comsumptionRate=90%
   - budget increases, ACOS also increases, because order increases not as much
   - up and down, TOS/ROS/PP all 3 placement seem to perform well
   - From Aug 10 – 16, this campaign was out of budget 20% of the time. Estimated missed sales: $165.00 - $511.00
   - shall we increase the budget? recommened 140, increase to 80
   - shall we decrease the bidding? suggest 0.47 vs. bid 0.80
   - total 17 orders, 13 from ASINs and 4 from keywords
2. Auto8-Black new campagin
   - fixed bid, 0.4, plus placement premiums
   - TOS = 0.4 (1 + 350%) = 1.8
   - ROS = 0.4 (1 + 350%) = 1.8
   - PP = 0.4 (1 + 0%) = 0.4
   - System suggests 1.04, lower than the past-7-day CPC=1.66

1. DAB-auto, decided to close due to its poor ACOS performance
   - Substitutes
   - default bidding=0.70, TOS=0.7(1 + 50%), ROS=0.7(1 + 30%), PP=0.7
   - Close this campaign due to high ACOS
2. DAB-Category
   - up and down, default bid=0.57
   - TOS 0, ROS=0.57(1 + 50%)1.5, PP=0.57(1 + 50%)1
   - the "up and down" appears fair in the UK, because clicking prices indeed go both sides
3. DAB-auto08, new campaign

   - daily budget=20, fixed, TOS 0, ROS 0, PP 0
   - is it necessary to bid twice the suggested prices?
